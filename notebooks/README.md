## 🗂️ Archive Structure

Legacy notebooks and development materials have been moved to `/archive/` to maintain clean project structure:

- `archive/legacy_notebooks/`: Historical development notebooks
- `archive/testing/`: Old testing and debugging notebooks
- `archive/legacy_scripts/`: Ad-hoc testing and diagnostic scripts

## 📚 Usage Guidelines

### For Framework Demonstrations
1. Start with `Complete_Environmental_Services_Demo_updated.ipynb` for comprehensive overview
2. Use `Service_Capabilities_Demo.ipynb` to explore specific service capabilities
3. Reference `Real_World_Data_Demonstration_Fixed.ipynb` for practical applications

### For Development and Testing
1. Use `comprehensive_earth_engine_test.py` for Earth Engine-specific validation
2. Check `/tests/` directory for comprehensive test suite
3. Reference `/examples/` for minimal working examples

### For Code Review
1. **Primary**: `Complete_Environmental_Services_Demo_updated.ipynb` - shows 100% operational framework
2. **Supporting**: `Service_Capabilities_Demo.ipynb` - demonstrates capability discovery
3. **Reference**: Documentation in `/docs/` directory for architectural details

## 🚀 Running Notebooks

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install framework
pip install -e .

# Install dependencies
pip install pandas>=2.0 pyarrow>=15 requests>=2.32 pydantic>=2.0 shapely>=2.0

# Set up credentials (optional for most services)
cp config/credentials.yaml.template config/credentials.yaml
```

### Execution Order
1. **First Time**: Run `Complete_Environmental_Services_Demo_updated.ipynb` to validate full framework
2. **Exploration**: Run `Service_Capabilities_Demo.ipynb` to understand available data
3. **Application**: Run `Real_World_Data_Demonstration_Fixed.ipynb` for practical examples

### Performance Notes
- Earth Engine requires Google Cloud credentials for full functionality
- Some services may have rate limits - notebooks include proper delay handling
- Cache clearing cells are included to ensure fresh module imports during development

## 📈 Expected Results

### Framework Status
- **10/10 Services Operational**: 100% success rate across all environmental services
- **Standardized Output**: All services return uniform 20-column data schema
- **Rich Metadata**: Earth Engine-level metadata richness across all sources
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling and fallback strategies

### Performance Metrics
- **Response Times**: < 5 seconds for typical queries
- **Data Coverage**: Global coverage with 1000+ environmental parameters
- **Reliability**: > 95% uptime across service portfolio
- **Quality**: Semantic metadata and provenance tracking for all data

This notebook collection demonstrates the complete environmental data unification framework, ready for integration into ECOGNITA agent architecture and production environmental intelligence applications.
