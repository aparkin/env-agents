class NewServiceAdapter(BaseAdapter):
    DATASET = "SERVICE_NAME"
    DOMAIN = "service_domain"  # air, water, land, ecology, etc.
    
    def capabilities(self):
        # Auto-discovery of available parameters
        
    def harvest(self):
        # Parameter catalog for semantic mapping
        
    def _fetch_rows(self, spec):
        # Standardized data retrieval
```
