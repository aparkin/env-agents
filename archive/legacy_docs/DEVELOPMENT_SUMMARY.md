- **Quality Assurance**: Data validation, quality scoring, and uncertainty quantification
- **Error Resilience**: Multi-layer fallback strategies and graceful degradation

## üîß Key Technical Fixes Delivered

### Critical Bug Fixes
1. **WQP HTTP 400 Error**: Fixed by implementing ECOGNITA two-step pattern (stations‚Üímeasurements‚Üícoordinate merge)
2. **Earth Engine Data Loss**: Fixed critical `notNull` filter bug (changed from band names list to band values)
3. **Module Cache Issues**: Resolved with cache clearing cells for fresh imports during development
4. **Coordinate Issues**: Fixed bbox coordinate ordering in Overpass adapter

### Architecture Improvements
1. **Unified API Pattern**: Ensured all services use consistent adapter interface instead of direct API calls
2. **Time Range Optimization**: Implemented broader time ranges for better data availability
3. **Error Handling Enhancement**: Comprehensive exception handling with meaningful error messages
4. **Performance Optimization**: Parallel service execution and intelligent batching

### Service-Specific Optimizations
- **WQP**: Two-step query pattern with station-measurement coordinate merging
- **Earth Engine**: Fixed filter logic for proper data extraction (0‚Üí4,188 records)
- **EPA AQS**: Bbox buffering for improved spatial coverage
- **SSURGO**: Direct SOAP API usage bypassing broken REST interface
